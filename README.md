## Machine Learning Model 

The proposed machine learning model at this stage is a linear regression that takes in race and county data to predict the percentage of the target demographic that lives within 0.25 miles from a liquor outlet. This target variable may also be changed from continuous to categorical (for example, 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 75%-100) so as to perform a logistical regression. 

Once more county data from other data sets, more models will be possible, such as a binary classifier that predicts whether child poverty is persistent in an area using race, county, income levels, and unemployment levels.
